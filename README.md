FuzzyKit is a fuzzy logic operation toolkit which includes the q-rung fuzzy sets,
q-rung interval-valued fuzzy sets and q-rung hesitant fuzzy sets.
The toolkit also includes the membership and non-membership degrees function
generator and element generator that can generate the fuzzy numbers, interval-valued 
fuzzy numbers and hesitant fuzzy elements. The membership degrees function generator 
of the toolkit already has eight built-in membership degree function. Moreover, users 
can use custom membership functions to construct membership function generators.

Four python packages are required:
1. numpy
2. scipy
