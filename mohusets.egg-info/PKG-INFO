# Mohusets(developing...)

Mohusets is a fuzzy logic and fuzzy mathematics toolkit which includes the q-rung intuitionistic 
fuzzy sets, q-rung interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets and q-rung dual hesitant fuzzy sets.
The tool mainly includes: the basic definition of fuzzy elements (fuzzy numbers) and some 
operation rules, the definition of fuzzy sets and some operation rules, generation of membership 
functions, generation of fuzzy elements, simple fuzzy measure including measure expression 
and fuzzy integral, etc., and finally A general aggregation operator of three kinds fuzzy elements.
